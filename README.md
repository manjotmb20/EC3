# EC3 Graph-based Consensus Maximization among Multiple Supervised and Unsupervised Models

The EC3 algorithm is a graph based maximization problem that deals with the meta output data of different classification algorithms. The baseline model that we choose to compare the algorithm against is BGCM, which is a model similar to the above algorithm. Below are described the files containing implementation for different datasets. 

Description of Files

ensemble.iypnb-: Initial implementation of EC3 algorithm on the titanic dataset and comparison of results with other algorithms.

Spambase.iypnb-: Similarly the implementation of the EC3 on the spambase dataset available online

Magic.iypnb-: For the EC3 implementation on the magic gamma dataset.

Adult.iypnb-: Containing the algorithm implementation on the adult.csv dataset.

BGCM.m: Implementation of BGCM algorithm which is another conensus based algorithm from the paper "Graph-based Consensus Maximization among Multiple Supervised and Unsupervised Models" to compare its results to the EC3 algorithm.



Datasets given-: train.csv( Titanic dataset), spam.csv(Spambase dataset), magic.csv( Magic Gamma Dataset)
