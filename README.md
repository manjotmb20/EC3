ensemble.iypnb-: Initial implementation of EC3 algorithm on the titanic dataset and comparison of results with other algorithms.
Spambase.iypnb-: Similarly the implementation of the EC3 on the spambase dataset available online
Magic.iypnb-: For the EC3 implementation on the magic gamma dataser.
BGCM.iypnb: Implementation of BGCM algorithm which is another conensus based algorithm from the paper "Graph-based Consensus Maximization among
Multiple Supervised and Unsupervised Models" to compare its results to the EC3 algorithm.
Datasets given-: train.csv( Titanic dataset), spam.csv(Spambase dataset), magic.csv( Magic Gamma Dataset)
